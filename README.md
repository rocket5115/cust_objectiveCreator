here, marker is chosen as my element to work with. I can either choose to move it down or up. If element is lower then it means it will be executed later than ones above it. 

Copy-to-Clipboard = copies .oc version of chosen element

Edit in workspace = copies current version of chosen element and takes you to workspace. After changes are made you must click sumbit button.

Move Down = Move element further down in execution queue

Move Up = Move element further up in execution queue

Remove = Remove chosen element

Execute Project = Execute current project(FiveM only), you can execute as many times as you want.

Export Project = copies .oc version of current project
