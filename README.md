Marker is my chosen element to work with. I can either:

-Copy the .oc version of it to my cliboard;

-Edit it in workspace

-Move up the priority

-Move down the priority

-Remove this element

-Execute Current *Project*

-Export .oc version of whole project

***About workspace***
You can use *Sumbit* button to either confirm changes or add new Element.

***About loops***

You **must** be careful, if loop doesn't have any type of break **or** break argument cannot be fulfilled this can lead to never ending loop unless script is restarted.

>To create loop you have to choose *Misc-Loop*. 
1. You'll find *exampleIdentifier*, type the name you want to use.
2. Go to *Misc-Break*. You can either have a marker as break argument or event. Script accepts event as every other value than "marker".
3. Remember to add Delay! Go to *Add Delay* and paste any number as to not crash your server!
4. Go to *Misc-Goto*. Type in identifier you want to go back to and you are ready to go!
